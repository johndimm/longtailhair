This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Long Tail 

I wrote this app because I have trouble finding anything I really want to watch on Amazon Prime or Netflix. Imagine if you will a distant future where there is a Truly Universal Steaming Service that has everything ever made. Sounds crazy but there is a precendent -- Spotify has every audio recording ever made. The app simulates such a service, up to the point of actually playing the movie.

I used the non-commercial data dump from imdb as base and added posters, plot summaries, and trailers from The Movie Database. There are over a million tv and movie titles.
